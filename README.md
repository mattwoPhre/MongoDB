# MongoDB

The project includes an MVC application that manage CRUD operation, and a Console Program that show, after a query, the first 5 elements in Database and makes the title of the first element in uppercase.
There are also the guide for a quick installation of MongoDb(MongoDB_HowToStart) and the collection to import on Db. 
The name of db is BookMVC, so if you change the name of database, take care to change the name also into the project.
